# Links to display in the left-hand sidebar of the home page.
#
# Each section has a name (as the "section" key), an "icon" (in
# "tool-name/icon-base-name" format), and a list of "links".  Each link
# requires either a "tool" key -- naming one of the tools -- or a "uri"
# key with the full URI of a link.  Links may optionally be supplied with
# "caption" properties to specify the text below the link, and tool links
# may have a "path" properties to specify a sub-path for the tool.
